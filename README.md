# GIS386-final-EMS-NYC
Final Project for the GIS386 - spatial algorithms class. 
This project takes in JSON data from a csv, parses through it to find certain incidents and then keep track of how many incidents of certain types happened and also in which zip codes. It also utilizes a zipcode feature layer. This is still in development/work in progress. 
Currently unable to create the heat maps for different types of incidents to give a visual on where incidents occur more often. 
Project utilizes JavaScript, HTML, and ArcGis Online features.

To view the the parsed data, hit the button on the website that says "Filter Through Zipcodes" and it will display the Zipcodes and their
Incident data to the console.
